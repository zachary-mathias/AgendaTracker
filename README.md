# AgendaTracker
This project is a simple tracker of my daughters daily agenda. My fianc√©e and I are trying to keep better track of her routine!
My initial thoughts are to have a few different categories of activities she partakes in a day. Keeping track of her eating schedule,
changed diapers, milestones and perhaps a fun column where we mark a funny moment with her. All marked with dates and times.
This will be vanilla js, html and css. It's mainly for practice, but it's everyday use for us will be very helpful to keep track of the little one.
